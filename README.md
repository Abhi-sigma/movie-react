# movie-react
We nepalese people love to watch south indian movies which is mostly in the languages
we dont understand.So,we have to rely on subtitles.

Thats fine as well but youtube uploaders decided that they are gonna catfish us.So,imagine
you have a day off tommorow and someone has recommended you a movie and you search for it and the realise there are numerous movies with the same name
and in reality that movie is not on youtube itself.So you waste time and most importantly the mood.

So why this project,
This project is a fusion of youtube and amazon prime xray feature and plus the enhanced search features.
For eg:when you search it shows a small thumbnail with not only the matched movie but actor,director that 
can cross reference a movie.
The movie search result takes you to the youtube link,whereas the person link will take you bio of that person 
with all the movies cross referenced to the person in database.Also,the admin features lets you to tag a movie and best part is adding a movie
which is very quick as all the data is retrieved by OMDB api which is pretty extensive in itself.
